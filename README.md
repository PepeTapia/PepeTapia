## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Strategic AI Director** and **Full Stack Builder** who bridges the gap between complex data science and tangible revenue. I don't just build models; I build **operational engines** that scale businesses.

As a first-generation college graduate, I successfully pivoted from High-Performance Esports Analytics to Enterprise Legal Tech. My philosophy is simple: **Anti-Chatbot, Pro-Intelligence.** I believe in building AI systems that provide actionable dashboards and predictive insights rather than generic conversational interfaces.

### ⚡ Current Focus
*   **Scaling Legal Operations:** Currently driving a 300% lead volume increase (1.5k -> 5k/mo) for a major Personal Injury firm.
*   **AI Auditing:** Helping companies pivot from stalled AI roadmaps to high-ROI, data-driven workflows.
*   **Enterprise Data Governance:** Architecting single-source-of-truth data warehouses for 500+ user organizations.

## 🛠️ The Modern Tech Stack

I operate as a "One-Man Army" capable of architecting, deploying, and scaling full-stack AI solutions.
