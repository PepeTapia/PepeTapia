# Hello, my name is Jose Antonio Tapia but you may call me Pepe. 

### My career passions are in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning(AI/ML). Outside of my career field I love playing video games, playing basketball, and going to Disneyland with my girlfriend. 

### Mixing my passions together has led to some fun projects including:
- AI/ML powered recording system for sports, specifically Basketball <img src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/256/man-bouncing-ball.png"  width="30" height="30">
- AI Coach for Video Games, specifically League of Legends 
- Computer Vision based tool to extract Data from a video game feed
- Other course based projects to build fundamentals!
