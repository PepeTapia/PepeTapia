## Professional me

<p align="left">
My career passions are in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning(AI/ML). I love telling stories through data and discovering new insights with the power of AI/ML. I first got started in AI/ML in the Fall of 2020, when I worked under an Assistant Professor to classify images of phytoplankton. My most recent project is an AI Coach for video games that provides actionable feedback for a player to improve their skills. I turned the AI Coach project into a company in which I am the CEO & AI/ML Lead. In any project I am a part of, I take ownership and apply myself to the best of my ability.

Outside of my career field I love playing video games, playing basketball, and going to Disneyland with my girlfriend. When I'm not spending time with loved ones, I love spending time helping people. I have coached competitive video games, esports, for gaming organizations Cloud9 and Tribe Gaming. My coaching branched out to traditional sports when I coached at the Escondido Police Athletic League for ages 6-18. I've done some individual coaching and tutoring throughout the last few years, and I believe it stems from my passion of helping people by using my passions as a medium. Whether it be coding or sports, I want to help people better themselves.

# Projects


<p> Mixing my passions together has led to some fun projects, including: </p>

---

## EPAL Project

### March 2022 - Present | Donations appreciated!

Github: Private , in development
<img src="https://github.com/PepeTapia/PepeTapia/blob/main/images/AWS_IMG_raspberrypi.png" alt="Raspberry Pi img" width="360" height="255" align="right">


AI/ML powered recording system for sports, specifically Basketball. I began this project because I wanted to see my brother's basketball games and have him assemble it himself as well. Using a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and internet connection, the system will be able to live stream the game to AWS and process the stream using AI/ML to create clips, keep score, and more!

<!-- Insert photo of Raspberry Pi image from my AWS Docuseries episode here -->

üîß **Tools used:** YOLOv5, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib; AWS: Kinesis/EC2/S3, Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, Python/C++

üß† **Concepts used:** Computer Vision, Object Detection, Transfer Learning on YOLOv5, End-to-End Pipeline development for Machine Learning, Data ETL Pipeline Development

## Meru AI

### October 2022 - Present | Donations appreciated!


Github: Private , in development 

<img src="https://github.com/PepeTapia/PepeTapia/blob/main/images/lol-logo-rendered-hi-res.png" alt="Leauge of Legends video game icon" width="504" height="308" align="right"> 

My passions in gaming and coaching inspired me to pursue this project. Our pilot game, League of Legends, is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena that contains an intimidating amount of information that a user needs to absorb in order to improve or even have fun playing the game. In short, I want to use AI/ML to answer questions that a user may have in regards to their own gameplay, helping them understand and improve on a personal level by providing them with actionable feedback - like a coach would do! 

üîß **Tools used:** Python, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Neo4j Graph Database, SQL

üß† **Concepts used:** Linear Regression, Multi-Class classification, Random Forests, CNN/RNN, GraphNN, Graph Database Relational Models, Data API Ingestion - ETL practices, Model Training/Testing/Evaluation

---

## WildAI

### September 2021 - June 2022

Github: [Wild AI](https://github.com/PepeTapia/WildAI)

<img src="https://github.com/PepeTapia/WildAI/blob/main/images/colorscale_img.png" alt="Wild Rift video stream example" width="383" height="217" align="right">


I created this tool to help my team at the time, Cloud9 Wild Rift, so we can use fundamental data analysis similar to the parent game League of Legends. Riot Games, the parent company for both aforementioned games, does not have a public API so I created a Data Pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads a Video Stream into a dataset. This enabled the potential for Data Science practices to be performed on the output datasets. The result was a number of datasets that helped our team discover our strengths and weaknesses, therefore making Data Informed Decisions.

üîß **Tools used:** YOLOv5, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, SQL

üß† **Concepts used:** Image Processing methods, Dataset organization and validation, Database creation, Data pipelin automation, Quantitative analysis

## AWS Scholarship 

### Scholarship Recepient | July 2022 

Read the full story here! 
Github: [AWS Scholarship Program: Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree](https://github.com/PepeTapia/UdacityAWS_Nanodegree)

<img src="https://github.com/PepeTapia/UdacityAWS_Nanodegree/blob/main/assets/AWS_Scholarship_ChapterModules.png" alt="AWS DeepRacer Student League course modules" width="368" height="162" align="right">


I applied for this scholarship at [awsaimlscholarship.com](http://awsaimlscholarship.com/). In order to be eligible, an applicant must complete the AWS DeepRacer Student League race and the provided AI/ML learning modules. This leads up to the applicant changing the code of a given template for training a "car" agent. The template is based on Reinforcement Learning and the goal is to complete a lap time under the 3:00 mark!

<img src="https://github.com/PepeTapia/PepeTapia/blob/main/images/udacity_course_topics.png" alt="AWS Udacity AI Scholarship Course modules" width="356" height="209" align="right">

Once you meet the eligibilty, you enter a pool of applicants that may be chosen for the Udacity "AI Programming with Python Nanodegree" course. This course covered the fundamentals within math, coding, and MLOps and tied it all together with an Image Classification system using transfer learning. You can look forward to learning about Linear Algebra, Calculus, Pandas, and NumPy for your math and coding fundamentals. From an AI/ML perspective the course does a great job at covering best data ETL pratices as well as the full model training, evaluation, and inference. The course projects concluded with two ways of using the same Image Classifier: Command Line Interface and Jupyter Notebook.
