## Professional me
<img src="https://github.com/PepeTapia/PepeTapia/blob/main/images/IMG-8199.JPG" align="right" height="290" width="410"> 

<p align="left">
My career passions are in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning(AI/ML). I love telling stories through data and discovering new insights with the power of AI/ML. I first got started in AI/ML in the Fall of 2020, when I worked under an Assistant Professor to classify images of phytoplankton. My most recent project is an AI Coach for video games that provides actionable feedback for a player to improve their skills. I turned this into a company in which I am the CEO & AI/ML Lead. In any project I am a part of, I take ownership and apply myself to the best of my ability.

<p align="left">
Outside of my career field I love playing video games, playing basketball, and going to Disneyland with my girlfriend. When I'm not spending time with loved ones, I love spending time helping people. I have coached competitive video games, esports, for gaming organizations Cloud9 and Tribe Gaming. My coaching branched out to traditional sports when I coached at the Escondido Police Athletic League for ages 6-18. I've done some individual coaching and tutoring throughout the last few years, and I believe it stems from my passion of helping people by using my passions as a medium. Whether it be coding or sports, I want to help people better themselves.

**Fun fact: I've completed over 50 Escape Rooms within Orange and Los Angeles counties üîçüïµÔ∏è. My favorite is "The Basement" in northern LA!**

## AWS Scholarship

Github: [AWS Scholarship Program: Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree](https://github.com/PepeTapia/UdacityAWS_Nanodegree)

I applied for this scholarship by completing the AWS DeepRacer Student League race. AWS provided applicants with AI/ML learning modules that leads up to the applicant changing the code of a given template for training a "car" agent. This template is based on Reinforcement Learning and the goal is to complete a lap time under the 3:00 mark!

<img src="https://github.com/PepeTapia/UdacityAWS_Nanodegree/blob/main/assets/inference_example.png" alt="Model Evaluation" width="279" height="419" align="right">

Once you meet the eligibilty, you enter a pool of applicants that may be chosen for the Udacity "AI Programming with Python Nanodegree" course. This course covered the fundamentals within math, coding, and MLOps and tied it all together with an Image Classification system using transfer learning. You can look forward to learning about Linear Algebra, Calculus, Pandas, and NumPy for your math and coding fundamentals. From an AI/ML perspective the course does a great job at covering best data ETL pratices as well as the full model training, evaluation, and inference. The course projects concluded with two ways of using the same Image Classifier: Command Line Interface and Jupyter Notebook.
