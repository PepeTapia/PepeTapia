## The Reality of AI in Production

I went from graduating in 2023 to being in the Executive Meeting rooms at a major law firm because of my diligence and perspective within AI. I focused on Business Value instead of hype and buzzwords. 

I audited companies that have burned months of runway building "chat with your data" wrappers that nobody uses. Employees don't want to chat. They want dashboards. They want answers.

My approach is simple: **Fix the process, then apply the AI.**

If your data is isolated in accounting, CRM, emails, and ticketing systems, an LLM won't fix that. You need a pipeline. I build engines that ingest messy real-world data and spit out actionable intelligence that protects margins and prints revenue.

### What I actually do
*   **Scale Operations:** I optimized a lead funnel, from end-to-end, that took us from 1,500 to 5,000 leads a month with a growing conversion rate of 7% to 12%
*   **Protect Revenue:** I built a predictive churn system architecture that flags at-risk clients before they leave by combining many disparate data sources and performing multi-modal analysis on the client lifecycle. This cut our "Substitution of Attorney" losses by 60%.
*   **Data Governance:** I moved 500+ users from chaotic local drives to a single-source-of-truth data warehouse.

## Tech Stack & Philosophy

The tech stack is secondary. Use what fits the use case and the comfort of your team. I use Python and FastAPI because they work, but I'm not dogmatic about it.

**Key Principle:** Modular design. Adding a new API source should take days, not weeks.

| **The Brain (GenAI)** | **The Engine (Cloud)** | **The Tools (Full Stack)** |

## Strategic Initiatives

### Confidential Personal Injury Firm (Director of AI)
*Proprietary Enterprise Transformation | 2025 - Present*

We were sitting on a goldmine of data, but our "Time on Desk" was 16 months. We were bleeding efficiency. I didn't just buy software; I engineered a flow that connected high-value callers to our best closers instantly.

*   **The Result:** Lead volume went from 1,500 to 5,000/month. Conversion jumped from 8% to 15%.
*   **The Speed:** Reduced pre-litigation lifecycle from 16 months to 8 months.
*   **The Tech:** Python, SQL, RingCentral APIs, Custom CRM Connectors.

### Meru AI (Founder)
*Bespoke AI Consultancy | 2022 - Present*

I started this to build products, but I realized the bigger need was guidance. I help clients stop fighting their own legacy infrastructure.

*   **The Pivot:** Shifted from generic dev shop to strategic auditing.
*   **The Win:** Helping clients move from "AI Toys" to "Operational Engines."
